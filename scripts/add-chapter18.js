        practicalExplanation: "In this final chapter, Arjuna asks about the distinction between sannyasa (renunciation of actions) and tyaga (relinquishment of fruits). This inquiry will lead to the Gita's ultimate teaching on liberation.",

        simpleMeaning: "It is not possible for one who has a body to completely abandon action. But one who relinquishes the fruits of action is called a true relinquisher.",
        practicalExplanation: "While embodied, complete inaction is impossible — even breathing and thinking are actions. True renunciation is giving up attachment to results, not giving up action itself. This practical wisdom applies to everyone.",

        practicalExplanation: "Actions bear fruit: bad, good, or mixed. Those attached to results experience these fruits after death. True renouncers, free from attachment, accumulate no karmic results. Detachment frees from karmic bondage.",
