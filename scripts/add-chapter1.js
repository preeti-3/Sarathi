        transliteration: "yadi mām apratīkāram aśhastraṁ śhastra-pāṇayaḥ dhārtarāṣhṭrā raṇe hanyus tan me kṣhemataraṁ bhavet",
        simpleMeaning: "It would be better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in hand, were to kill me unarmed and unresisting in battle.",
        practicalExplanation: "Arjuna would rather die than fight — the ultimate escape from duty. This is not courage or sacrifice; it is sophisticated avoidance wearing spiritual clothes.",
