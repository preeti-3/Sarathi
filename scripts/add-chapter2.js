        simpleMeaning: "It would be better to live in this world by begging than to slay these great souls who are my teachers. If I kill them, all my enjoyments will be tainted with blood.",
        practicalExplanation: "Arjuna prefers poverty to fighting his teachers. This seems noble but ignores that these teachers chose the wrong side. Misplaced loyalty perpetuates adharma.",

        strengthReflection: "I seek inner peace knowing that external achievements alone cannot heal my deepest struggles.",
        devotionalSurrender: "Lord, no worldly gain can give me what I truly seek. Only You can remove the grief of my soul.",

        practicalExplanation: "Arjuna declares 'I will not fight' and falls silent. His declaration seems final, but his silence creates space for Krishna's teaching. Sometimes we must exhaust our arguments before we can truly listen.",
