        simpleMeaning: "Arjuna said: Out of compassion for me, You have revealed the supreme secret concerning the self. By Your words, my delusion is now dispelled.",
        practicalExplanation: "Arjuna acknowledges Krishna's teaching — given out of pure compassion, it has removed his confusion. This grateful recognition shows the disciple's receptivity. Delusion lifts when sacred teachings enter an open heart.",

        practicalExplanation: "Arjuna adds humble qualification: 'if You think I'm capable.' Divine vision isn't guaranteed to all — the seer must be ready.

        simpleMeaning: "But you cannot see Me with these physical eyes. Therefore I give you divine vision. Behold My divine power!",
        practicalExplanation: "Physical eyes cannot perceive the cosmic form. Krishna gifts divine vision (divya chakshus). This is grace — the capacity to see God is itself given by God. Human effort alone cannot reach this; divine enablement is required.",

        simpleMeaning: "If a thousand suns were to rise together in the sky, such splendor might resemble the radiance of that great being.",
        practicalExplanation: "The famous 'thousand suns' verse: imagine a thousand suns rising simultaneously — perhaps this might approximate the brilliance of the cosmic form. But even this analogy falls short. Language strains to describe the indescribable.",
