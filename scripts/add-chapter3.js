        transliteration: "arjuna uvācha jyāyasī chet karmaṇas te matā buddhir janārdana tat kiṁ karmaṇi ghore māṁ niyojayasi keśhava",
        simpleMeaning: "Arjuna said: O Janardana, if You consider knowledge superior to action, why then do You ask me to engage in this terrible war, O Keshava?",
        practicalExplanation: "Arjuna is confused - if wisdom is higher than action, why fight? This is a common misunderstanding. True wisdom expresses through right action, not inaction.",
        strengthReflection: "I understand that true wisdom is demonstrated through right action, not through avoidance.",

        simpleMeaning: "My intellect is confused by Your ambiguous words. Tell me decisively that one path by which I can attain the highest good.",
        practicalExplanation: "Arjuna wants one clear path. But life isn't that simple - different situations require different approaches. The wise integrate multiple truths rather than seeking oversimplification.",
        strengthReflection: "I embrace complexity rather than demanding oversimplified answers.",
        devotionalSurrender: "Lord, give me clarity that embraces the wholeness of truth.",

        practicalExplanation: "There are two valid paths: knowledge for the contemplative mind, action for the active personality. Both lead to the same goal. Choose according to your nature.",
        strengthReflection: "I choose the path that suits my nature, knowing all sincere paths lead to truth.",

        simpleMeaning: "Not by merely abstaining from action does one attain freedom from karma, nor does one attain perfection by mere renunciation.",
        practicalExplanation: "Running away from action doesn't free you from karma. External renunciation without internal transformation is useless. True freedom comes from how you act, not whether you act.",
        strengthReflection: "I seek freedom through transformed action, not through avoidance.",

        simpleMeaning: "Indeed, no one can remain without action even for a moment. Everyone is driven to act helplessly by the qualities born of material nature.",
        practicalExplanation: "Complete inaction is impossible - even sitting still involves action. Nature forces us to act. Since action is inevitable, the question is not whether to act but how to act wisely.",
        strengthReflection: "Since I must act anyway, I choose to act consciously and wisely.",

        simpleMeaning: "One who restrains the organs of action but mentally dwells on sense objects is deluded and is called a hypocrite.",

        transliteration: "niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ śharīra-yātrāpi cha te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ",
        simpleMeaning: "Perform your prescribed duties, for action is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible through inaction.",

        simpleMeaning: "Work done as a sacrifice for the Supreme frees one from bondage. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your duties for His sake, free from attachment.",
        practicalExplanation: "Action binds only when done selfishly. Action done as offering to the Divine liberates. The same action produces bondage or freedom depending on the spirit behind it.",

        simpleMeaning: "In the beginning, the Creator created humanity together with sacrifice and said: By this shall you prosper; may this fulfill all your desires.",

        simpleMeaning: "The righteous who eat the remnants of sacrifice are freed from all sins. But those who cook only for themselves eat only sin.",
        practicalExplanation: "Those who first offer and then enjoy are freed from sin. Those who consume only for self-interest accumulate negativity. Share before you consume.",
